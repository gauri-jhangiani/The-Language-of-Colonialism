Speech: 

Gentlemen,— I desire to return you my best thanks for 
your address of welcome. It is very gratifying to me that 
the inhabitants of one of the most ancient cities of India 
should have anticipated my approach by such kindly expressions of regard. In referring to her Majesty’s deep solicitude for the welfare of her Indian subjects, you have 
in no degree misinterpreted her feelings. There is nothing which passes in this country which our gracious 
Sovereign does not carefully watch ; and having been summoned to her presence before my departure, she laid upon me her commands to do everything in my power to promote the happiness and welfare of all classes and sections within the circuit of her Eastern Empire. I have observed 
with extreme pleasure the loyal manner in which the natives 
of India have expressed themselves towards your present 
Viceroy, whose benignant administration will be long 
remembered by a grateful people, and it will be one of my 
most interesting tasks to watch over the operation of those 
municipal institutions whose development His Excellency 
has so studiously fostered. At the same time it is needless 
to add that both your agricultural and mercantile prosperity 
will be my constant care. In conclusion, allow me to thank 
you for the complimentary terms in which your address has 
been couched, and the loyal spirit it evinces towards the 
future representative of the Crown in this country.
