Speech: 

Gentlemen,— The first address of welcome I received in 
India was from the members of your Corporation, when, 
as far as I could judge the political atmosphere, seemed 
clear, when apparently the chief task before me was the 
direction of my administration on the lines laid down by 
my distinguished predecessors. Five years have rolled 
by since then, five strenuous years of which history will 
have much to tell, You know the story of my Viceroyalty, 
Gentlemen, how it has been marked by the development 
of new hopes and ambitions, by political unrest and many 
anxieties and dangers, and I cannot sufficiently thank 
you for your appreciation of my endeavour to deal with 
a position of peculiar complexity. I sadly realize that this 
is the last of the many kind addresses which have been 
presented to me during the past few weeks, they have 
emanated from bodies differing in many essential characteristics—in religion, in nationality, in mode of life, but they have, all breathed the same sentiments of loyalty 
to the Throne and appreciation and gratitude for the 
various measures that have been taken by: the Government 
of India during my term of office, in consideration of the 
political and social aspirations of the people, and to 
ensure the tranquility of the country committed to their 
charge. You can well understand. Gentlemen, how gratifying it is to me to have been the recipient of such an address, and to be able to lay down the reins of Government 
with the full assurance that however incomplete the 
task I set before me may be, I have at least earned the 
goodwill of the general body of my fellow-subjects in 
India, whether Indian or European, And now I am about 
to leave your beautiful land, I must take this opportunity 
of thanking not only you, Gentlemen, tor your cordial and 
sympathetic address, but every class and community to 
whose loyal support and co-operation I owe any success 
which has attended my efforts in guiding the destinies of 
the Indian Empire, and of bidding them a final and regretful farewell. I shall have much pleasure in conveying to the King-Emperor your assurances of loyalty and devotion 
to the Throne. I thank you on behalf of Lady Minto, as
well as of myself, for all your kind words, and we wish 
you good-bye with many affectionate remembrances of India 
and her people.
