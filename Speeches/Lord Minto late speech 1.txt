Speech: 

Gentlemen,â€” This is, as you have reminded me, the third 
occasion on which the members of the Bombay Chamber 
of Commerce have presented me with an address, the 
last occasion was very little more than a year ago we 
remember it, for you touched upon topics of great commercial and political interest which had given me much cause for careful consideration., and as to which I fully recognise 
the extent to which your interests were affected and which 
I was anxious to assist as far as possible. It is, therefore, 
a great pleasure to me to hear that the Government of 
India have been able to some extent to meet your views. 
But, Gentlemen, on looking back at the public work of the 
last twelve months we cannot but, recollect that a great 
shadow has darkened the horizon of the Empire in the
death of our beloved King-Emperor, to whose memory his 
subjects are now striving to do honour. You have alluded, 
Gentlemen, to the enlargement of the Legislative Councils 
inaugurated during my administration, and you assure me 
of the benefits a wider consideration of public affairs and 
a closer touch between the various communities and the 
Government of India will in your belief confer upon the 
population; and with the recollection of the many difficulties that had to be faced I cannot tell you how sincerely I value your assurance. Whilst not only is the political 
atmosphere cleared, but there is every prospect of agricultural prosperity, I congratulate you on the future outlook. It is hard to realize that five years have passed since you 
first welcomed me to Bombay, and that you are now bidding me farewell. I hope the great interests you represent will continue to grow and flourish, and I thank you 
sincerely, Gentlemen, for your kindly words and for your 
good wishes to Lady Minto and to myself on our departure 
from India.
