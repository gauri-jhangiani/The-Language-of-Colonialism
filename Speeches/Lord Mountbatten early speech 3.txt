Speech:



It gives me the greatest pleasure to receive you today, in 

your capacity as the first Ambassador to India of the Chinese Republic. From time immemorial, as you have said, 
China and India have been linked by cultural ties and close 
associations of friendship and trade. Their relations have 
never been marred by hostility or strife, an almost unique 
record in history. More recently the two countries passed 
through a close comradeship in arms against aggression; together they achieved a common victory. Speaking from personal experience I had the honour in my last appointment of 
having two Chinese Armies placed under my command by the 
Generalissimo, and they played an outstanding part in the 

liberation of Northern Burma and the opening of the land 
road from India to China. I also had the pleasure of paying 
two visits to Chungking and of establishing a most friendly 
relationship with His Excellency the President of the Republic of China. It is, therefore, a particular pleasure for me 
to welcome you today. 

For the future I also do not doubt that these many bonds 
will be strengthened to the mutual advantage of India and 
China and these two lands, both ancient in history but both 
on the road to a new and high destiny will strive with energy, 
in concert with the other United Nations, to establish a lasting 
era of progress and peace. 

On behalf of His Majesty and the Government of India, 
I extend to Your Excellency a most cordial welcome, and 
assure you at all times, of our fullest co-operation.
