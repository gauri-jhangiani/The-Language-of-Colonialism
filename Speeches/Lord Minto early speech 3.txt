Speech: 

Mr. Chairman and Commissioners of the Corporation 
of Calcutta,â€” I thank you for the very kind words of your 
address, and I would ask you to convey to the citizens my 
sincere appreciation of the cordiality of the welcome they 
have extended to Her Excellency Lady Minto and myself 
on our arrival at the capital of the Indian Empire. 

I thank you too, Mr. Chairman, for your reference to my 
past services, and I can assure you that nothing is more 
gratifying to me on my assumption of office than to hear 
from you that I have the good wishes of the people of India, 

The century which has elapsed since my ancestor 
administered the government of this country has witnessed, 
as you say, not only great territorial additions to the 
Empire, but a vast increase in material wealth and in 
intellectual resource, whilst you may well be proud of the 
development of the beautiful city of Calcutta, a development 
in which you will always have my cordial sympathy. 

I thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for your kind expressions towards me, and I share with the Corporation of Calcutta their earnest hope for the welfare of the people of India.
