Speech: 

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, â€” I have to thank you 
cordially for the words of welcome and confidence which 
I have just heard, and for the suggestions which you have 
made concerning the measures for increasing and intensifying that commercial and industrial enterprize with which your magnificent city is so intimately associated. It is 
hardly necessary for me to say that I thoroughly sympathise with you in your desire for still further developing the natural resources of the country, and that it will 
be my constant endeavour to aid and encourage within 
the limits of the means at our disposal, all legitimate 
and practical schemes which have that object as their aim. 
Before leaving England I had the advantage of having 
your views regarding railway extension presented to me 
by very competent authorities, and I was fully impressed 
with the necessity of constantly keeping the means of 
communication on a level with industrial and commercial 
requirements. That the principle is a sound one there 
can be no doubt ; but I cannot of course express any 
opinion as to how it is to be applied until I have had 
time to consider the question carefully in all its bearings. All that I can say, therefore, for the present is, that I shall consider your suggestions with the care and 
attention which are due to a body so deeply interested 
in the question and so competent to form a sound judgment 
upon it. In conclusion, gentlemen, I have to thank you 
personally, and through you the great mercantile class 
which you so worthily represent, for the very kind reception which I have met with in Bombay.
