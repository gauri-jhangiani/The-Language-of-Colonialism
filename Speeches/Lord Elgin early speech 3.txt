Speech: 

Mr. Framjee Petit and Gentlemen, — I assure you that, 
so far as I am concerned, no apology is necessary from you 
for putting before me, in the manner you have done, the 
views which you entertain in regard to matters so important to the trade in which you are interested. You modestly describe it as a matter personal to yourselves ; but a trade 
so important cannot be treated as a personal matter. It 
affects the whole community, and it is therefore extremely valuable to me to know what those whose knowledge is so comprehensive as yours think of the circumstances. You 
will easily understand, however, that, at the present moment, I can only receive information, and that while I may properly thank you for approaching me personally, I must, as 
you yourselves suggest, await the time when you address 
the Government through the ordinary channels to give 
expression to any views that I may form on the matters 
involved in your address. I should wish, however, to be 
permitted to refer for a moment to your remarks more 
personal to myself. I am grateful for your reference to 
my father’s name, remembering as I do how much of his 
life’s work was associated with the promotion of British 
trade, and I am also specially grateful to you for recognising that I have myself not altogether neglected the opportunities that have offered to inform myself on questions 
affecting industrial pursuits. Gentlemen, as you say, the 
responsibilities of my office will be onerous, and I shall 
esteem myself fortunate if in the discharge of them I am 
able to be of service to you.
