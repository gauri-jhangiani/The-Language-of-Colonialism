Speech:

I have no intention of making a speech to you. I do 
feel however that I cannot let this occasion pass without 
saying a very few words of welcome and thanks to the very 
many eminent scientists who have honoured this University by their presence at the 34th Session of the Indian 
Science Congress. It has been a very great occasion of 
instruction, encouragement, and pleasure not only to the 
Science Faculty of this University but to every other 
University in the country, and to India as a whole. 
The interest of India in scientific subjects has been 
testified by the many thousands of laymen who have been 
attracted by the lectures delivered at the Conference, and 
have had their interest in science quickened by the admirable discourses they have heard from masters of a subject. 

I therefore offer you, as Chancellor of this University 
and as head of the Indian Government, our most grateful 
thanks for coming so many thousands of miles and for 
making such a very notable success of this Session of the 
Indian Science Congress.
