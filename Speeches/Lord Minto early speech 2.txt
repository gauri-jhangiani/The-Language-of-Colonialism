Speech: 

Gentlemen,— I sincerely thank you for the congratulations you have so cordially extended to me on my 
appointment as Viceroy of India, and I trust, that possibly 
the experience I have gained during my period of office in 
Canada may, as you suggest, assist me in my future Indian 
administration. 

The disastrous effects of the plague to which you 
so earnestly call my attention necessitate every effort to 
combat its ravages, and I can assure you you may rely on 
my sincerest sympathy and hearty assistance, 

I can scarcely as yet venture to make any pronouncement 
on the commercial policy of India, but I have had ample 
evidence in my Canadian experience that trade follows 
the railway, and I am well aware that it is to the expert 
opinions of associations such as yours that I am entitled to 
look for that expression of commercial thought which must 
take the lead in the development upon which the prosperity 
of every country so largely depends. 

The great interest Lord Curzon has taken in all commercial questions and his creation of a Department of Industry and Commerce have already been followed by substantial
results, whilst I am convinced that in the encouragement of
the great agricultural capabilities of this country lies much 
of the future prosperity and contentment of its people. 

The importance of the interests so ably represented 
by yourselves and similar associations in other great 
centres of trade can hardly be overrated, and I thank you, Gentlemen, not only for the kindness of your welcome, but for the opportunity you have afforded me of meeting you to-day.
