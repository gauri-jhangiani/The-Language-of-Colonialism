Speech: 

It is proposed that the Council should meet again this 
day week. When that time comes I shall no longer have 
the right of presiding over your deliberations. This chair 
will be filled by my successor, sitting face to face with the 
portrait of his illustrious father, the inheritor of a distinguished name, to which there is every reason to believe that he will add yet further distinction. I cannot allow the 
Hon'ble Members of this Council to separate to-day 
without expressing to them my thanks for the personal 
consideration with which they have always treated me 
both in and out of this room; and I say this, not only with 
reference to those who are here to-day, some of whom are 
taking part in our proceedings for the first time, but with 
reference to all those gentlemen who, during the last five 
years, have had a seat in the Legislative Council. 

I part from the Council with feelings of great regret 
and of sincere respect and regard for its Members, I 
earnestly trust that this Council, strengthened as it has 
lately been by the extension of its functions, and by the 
addition to its ranks of a larger number, of representative members, some of whom will owe their presence to the recommendation of their fellow-citizens, will enjoy 
an ever-increasing share of public confidence, that it will 
conduct its deliberations with wisdom, dignity, and moderation, and that it will prove to be a new source of stability and usefulness to the institutions of this country. I feel 
sure that Lord Elgin will receive from the Members of this 
Council the same assistance and the same courtesy which 
the Council has never failed to extend to me. 

Gentlemen, I bid you farewell.
